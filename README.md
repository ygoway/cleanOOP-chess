# cleanOOP-chess
in progress

Hello everyone!
There is code that explain a chess in OOP style, clearly as I can.

There will be commit stages with packaging changes & output-terminal images.
In first commit we have an board with coordinates and abstract piece with extended specefic objs.
Implemented some board set up and some rendering to replicate progress. 
Output-terminal image shows a board withot pieces.
None tests now.
